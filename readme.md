# Diablo 3: Game Guide Tools
    
Some tools dealing with the [Diablo 3 Game Guide](https://eu.diablo3.com/de/game/) and links to legendary items like [Buriza-Do Kyanon](https://eu.diablo3.com/de/item/burizado-kyanon-Unique_XBow_011_x1).

* Scan the game guide to collect all item links, and search for a specific link by item name
* Also collect links to all skills (active and passive) of the Diablo 3 hero classes
* When searching for an item or skill, a proper URL to that item is copied into the clipboard, to be pasted into the forum editor.
* URLs can be created as pure URL, within code tags (for users with Trust Level 0-2 in the forums) or with full Markdown syntax (for users with Trust Level 3 in the forums).

 Note: This program will try to create two files in your Diablo III settings directory (usually "my documents\Diablo III") to save settings and the item link information. 
 
 If you select the option "Download item graphics" a directory "ItemPics" will be created in your Diablo III settings directory as well.

## Deactivated functions in the binary

The following functions are deactivated in the most current binary, because of the new forums.

* Create some part of a JS code needed for a userscript to fix the old links in other players guides in your browser. 
I used this to create this [Userscript](http://dh-deluxe.de/files/downloads/D3-Item-Guide-Wizard.user.js). However, this is also outdated ;-).
