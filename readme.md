Some tools dealing with the Diablo 3 Game Guide and links to legendary items.

* Scan the game guide to collect all item links, and search for a specific link by item name

 Note: This program will try to create two files in your Diablo III settings directory (usually "my documents\Diablo III") to save settings and the item link information. 
 
 If you select the option "Download item graphics" a directory "ItemPics" will be created in your Diablo III settings directory as well.

## Deactivated functions in the binary

The following functions are deactivated in the most current binary, because of the new forums.

* Replace the "old" item links with the current ones in your guides on the Diablo 3 Forums.

* Create some part of a JS code needed for a userscript to fix the old links in other players guides in your browser. 
I used this to create this [Userscript](http://dh-deluxe.de/files/downloads/D3-Item-Guide-Wizard.user.js). However, this is also outdated ;-).
