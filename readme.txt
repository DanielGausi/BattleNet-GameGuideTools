    Some tools dealing with the Diablo 3 Game Guide and links to legendary items.

    - Scan the game guide to collect all item links, and search for a specific link 
      by item name
    - Replace the "old" item links with the current ones in your guides on the
      Diablo 3 Forums.
    - Create some part of a JS code needed for a userscript to fix the old links
      in other players guides in your browser. 
      * I used this to create this script:
        http://dh-deluxe.de/files/downloads/D3-Item-Guide-Wizard.user.js 

    - Note: This program will try to create two files in your Diablo III settings 
            directory (usually "my documents\Diablo III") to save settings and the
            item link information.
